This market growth is attributed to the increasing consumer demand for ready-to-eat food products, particularly in emerging economies where the consumption of instant noodles and convenience foods is rising rapidly. As noodles are a widely consumed product globally, preservatives play a crucial role in extending shelf life and ensuring food safety, which in turn drives the demand for these preservatives across the food manufacturing industry.</p><p>Another key factor driving the market growth is the rising focus on enhancing the taste, texture, and freshness of noodles.
